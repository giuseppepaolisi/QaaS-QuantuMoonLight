QuantuMoonLight: A QaaS Platform to experiment typical Machine Learning pipeline through Quantum Computers

<h1>QuantuMoonLight</h1>

QuantuMoonLight is the major user-friendly web platform aimed at quantum computation and machine learning enthusiasts, industry professionals, students and researchers.

The main function of the system is to allow registered users to perform common operation as validation, preprocessing, classifications, regression and more on datasets uploaded by users.

Quantum Machine Learning is a little-known area and therefore we want to extend the interested community, trying to offer a product simple, reliable and useful, using the solutions made available by newest Quantum Computing and Cloud Computing technologies

The goal of the project is to observe the variation of the metrics of a quantum classification algorithm by applying preprocessing techniques that decrease the dimensionality of a dataset in favor of execution time.

Due to this automation of mechanisms, this project enable a new area of computer science that aims to ease software practitioners to intercat with typical pipeline of machine learning 

The purpose of this project is to provide through the paradigm “Quantum-as-a-Services” the Machine Learning algorithms used in the QML platform: from validation and feature engineering methods to the creation and use of the quantum classification model .
